# BankTracking

This Gem pulls market data from the Bittrex API and allows you to sort crpyto-currencies by volume or search by ticker.

```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install bank_tracking

## Usage

Run ruby bin/start-app and type in 1 to sort all crypto-currencies by volume or type 2 to search by ticker. Then type in the ticker to view a list of markets for the ticker including the volume and the Bid and the Ask.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
